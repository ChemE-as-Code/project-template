# Editing the 3D layout

## Purpose and when to use

Edit the 3D layout in `layout/` and keep it consistent with the equipment list and clear of
clashes, then build the generated 3D model (`layout/plant-model.yaml`) and look at it. Use it
when placing, moving or resizing equipment, or adding a building, structure, zone, area, road
or rack. Pipe routes: skill `pipe-routing`; steel, platforms and access: `structures-access`;
hazardous and oxygen zones: `area-classification`.

## Required inputs and missing inputs

The optional files explained in `layout/README.md` (`site-plan.yaml`, `building.yaml`,
`equipment-placement.yaml`, `structures.yaml`, `zones.yaml`, and `piping/routing.yaml`), and
the sizes in the equipment list; the schemas are `plantcode schema site_plan`, `building`,
`placement`, `structures`, `zones` and `routing`.
Coordinates are metres, x east, y north, z up, origin at the site's south-west corner.

1. **Read first**: `layout/site-plan.yaml` for the site box and what is already taken (areas,
   roads, racks), `layout/building.yaml` for building outlines and level elevations, and
   `equipment/equipment-list.yaml` for the tags and types.

A dimension not known yet may be estimated: mark it `notes: ASSUMED ...` (step 2).

## Workflow and tools

2. **Sizes live in the equipment list**, not in the placement: give each item
   `dimensions:` in `equipment/equipment-list.yaml` -- overall `{diameter, height}` (vertical:
   from the bottom of the skirt or legs to the top of the head), `{diameter, length}`
   (horizontal: over both heads or channels; optional `height`, the top of the shell, when it
   sits on saddles), or `{length, width, height}` (pumps, skids, plate exchangers, packages),
   with `head` and `support` where you know them. The DEXPI class in `type` picks the shape
   family (column with skirt and heads, tank with roof and spiral stair, shell-and-tube
   exchanger with channel and bundle-pull space, end-suction pump with volute, coupling guard
   and motor on a baseplate, integrally geared compressor, ...). For a machine,
   `orientation: vertical` draws a vertical inline pump, and `variant` picks another drawing
   (`cryogenic` for a pump with an insulated cold end, `blower`, `compander`, `expander`,
   `machine` for a plain casing and motor); the model puts the machine's nozzles on its real
   flanges, and items at grade on concrete plinths or foundations. Unknown sizes are fine to
   estimate: say so (`notes: ASSUMED ...`) and record the basis in `DESIGN.md`. Give heavy
   items their empty `weight` (t): the lifting rule needs a crane for 5 t and more. Where the P&ID
   states a size (capacity, cylinder or tube length, shell diameter) the two must agree
   (`plantcode.equipment-dimension-mismatch`).
   **Placing equipment** (`layout/equipment-placement.yaml`):
   - one entry per equipment-list tag, spelled exactly as in the list (`plantcode.layout-unknown-tag`
     otherwise); every listed item should get one (`layout-not-placed` is reported as info).
     An internal of another item (a condenser-reboiler in a column sump) has no placement of
     its own: accept its `layout-not-placed` finding in `checks/checks.yaml` with the reason,
     and skip its internal lines in `piping/routing.yaml`;
     Silencers, vent stacks' relief valves and other items of `piping/special-items.yaml` may be
     placed too, by their tag (they are not reported as not placed); they have no
     dimensions, so they take `size` in the placement;
   - `position` is the centre of the footprint and the **bottom** elevation: `[x, y, 0]` at
     grade; `rotation_deg` turns the item's own x (the axis of a horizontal drum or exchanger,
     a pump's shaft from suction to motor) away from east. On a building level give
     `mount: {building: B-1, level: GF}` and set `z` to that level's `elevation` (`layout-level`,
     0.05 m tolerance), keep the whole footprint inside the building and the item's height
     within the level's clear height;
   - a containment around tanks is an area of `kind: bund` in the site plan with its
     `wall_height` (inside the storage area); a building that has an overhead crane declares
     `crane: {capacity_t, rail_elevation?}` in `layout/building.yaml` (the model adds the
     runway, bridge and hook, and the roof, doors and louvres of a clad building);
   - `shape` only overrides what the dimensions give (`box`, `vertical_cylinder`,
     `horizontal_cylinder`, `sphere`); `size` is a stop-gap for an item without dimensions
     (`layout-size-from-placement`, info) and is ignored next to them (`layout-size-ignored`);
   - nozzles are taken from the P&ID with their DN and lines and put on the side the P&ID draws
     them on. Where that is wrong -- a nozzle that must face the rack, a manway at a platform --
     override it: `nozzles: [{id: N1, angle_deg: 90, elevation: 2.5}]` or
     `[{id: N2, face: top, offset: [0.5, 0]}]` (see `layout/README.md`). An override must name a
     nozzle of the P&ID (`layout-nozzle-unknown`).
3. **Avoiding clashes** (`plantcode.layout-clash`): plantcode compares the boxes around each
   shape after rotation. Leave maintenance and access space - about 1 m around pumps, a
   tube-bundle pull length in front of a shell-and-tube exchanger - even though plantcode only
   flags real intersections. Keep equipment off roads and out of buildings it is not placed
   in. Pumps may stand at grade **under** a pipe rack, the usual arrangement in a rack-type plot
   plan, as long as their top stays at least 0.5 m below the lowest tier; anything taller goes
   beside the rack. Put a pump close to its suction source (a tank or vessel it draws from):
   a long suction line costs NPSH, and for a reciprocating pump also brings pulsation.
   Buildings must not stand on roads or overlap each other, and a rack may cross a building
   only with its lowest tier above the building's top. `plantcode layout build` writes the
   maintenance envelopes (bundle pull, motor removal, pump access) into `layout/plant-model.yaml`,
   where the viewer shows them: keep them free.
4. **Site plan**: give every area a road: trucks must reach loading areas, and the process
   area needs fire-fighting access, ideally from more than one side. Areas are `[x0, y0, x1, y1]` with x0 < x1, y0 < y1 and should not overlap
   (`layout-area-overlap`); split a plot into adjacent areas instead of nesting them. Everything
   stays inside `site.width` x `site.depth` (`layout-outside-site`).
5. **Racks and lines**: lines between areas, or longer than 30 m, need a rack route
   (`plantcode.layout-line-route`): extend or add a rack so both ends are within `rack_reach`
   (default: the 30 m unsupported length) of it and the racks touch. Vent and relief lines count: place the silencers and
   relief valves (from `piping/special-items.yaml`) or give the line `to_area: <vent area>`.
   Use the `layout-line-length` estimates for line lengths, never guess them.
6. **Spacing criteria** (toppling radius, distances to tanks, roads, the boundary) go into
   `separations:` of `site-plan.yaml` (see `layout/README.md`), so validate measures them
   (`plantcode.layout-separation`). Between equipment items the build also applies a package
   spacing table by family or DEXPI class (fired equipment 15 m, pumps 1 m, machines 3 m,
   columns 3 m, ..., every row ASSUMED: `plantcode.layout-spacing`); a separation naming both
   items replaces the table for that pair, `criteria: {spacing_table: false}` switches it off.
   The other layout criteria of the rules (operator height, escape travel, heavy lift, crane
   reach) are overridden under the same `criteria:` key with the site standard's values. Model a cold box or fire wall as a building with its height,
   or a tagged box. Quote **measured** distances in `DESIGN.md`: `plantcode show <tag> --layout`
   prints them; never write a distance you have not measured.
7. **Buildings** turn only in steps of 90 degrees, about their `origin` corner. Column grid
   offsets are along the building's own x and y and must lie within its width and depth.

7a. **What an item stands on** (`mount:`): at grade, nothing (`z = 0`); on a building level
   `mount: {building, level}`; on a steel frame of `layout/structures.yaml` `mount: {structure,
   level}` with `z` at the level's elevation (skill `structures-access` says when an item
   belongs on a structure). An item stacked on another (an LP column on its HP column) stands
   on it: its `z` is the other's top. Every item above grade must be mounted or stacked (gate
   `layout-3d`, requirement `mounted`).
7b. **Nozzles** come from the P&ID side; override the ones that must face elsewhere
   (`nozzles:` of the placement, step 2). A piped nozzle placed `basis: default` (no drawn
   position: `plantcode.layout-nozzle-defaulted`) needs an override before the basic gate
   (`nozzles`).
7c. **Access** (`access: {platforms: [{elevation, arc_deg?, width?}], ladder_side}` of a
   vertical item): without it `layout build` proposes platforms for nozzles and valves more
   than 2.5 m up (`review_needed`). Review each proposal (skill `structures-access`), then pin
   it (`plantcode layout pin TAG/platform-1`) or declare your own.
7d. **Structures** (`layout/structures.yaml`: `origin`, `spans_x`/`spans_y`, `levels` deck or
   platform with `extent`, `bracing`, `stairs`, `ladders`, `enclosure` for a cold box casing or
   fire wall) and **zones** (`layout/zones.yaml`: keep-clear, laydown, maintenance, escape as
   explicit volumes; hazardous, oxygen-enriched and oxygen-deficient zones explicit or from
   `sources`, skill `area-classification`; `crane_pad` where a mobile crane stands, with its
   `reach_m`). Forbidden zones (keep clear, laydown, maintenance, escape, crane pad) are
   obstacles for the router. An enclosure takes `openings` like a building; the build lists the
   pipes through walls outside them as `penetrations` (`plantcode layout pin OWNER/LINE`).
7e. **Pipe routes** (`piping/routing.yaml`): rules (rack tiers per fluid, battery limits, the
   pipe-way elevation, vent riser heights) and intent per line (`rack`, `tier`, `via`,
   `elevation`, `skip: reason`, pinned `route`): skill `pipe-routing`.

## Validation and failure handling

8. **The build loop.** After every change to the layout, the lists or a P&ID:
   1. `plantcode validate`: fix every `plantcode.layout-*` error first (a `yaml.schema` error
      names the line; `layout build` refuses while a layout file is invalid);
   2. `plantcode layout build` writes `layout/plant-model.yaml`, the generated 3D model (never
      edit it: `layout-model-edited`); it prints the clash, headroom, access and nozzle
      findings. `--check` only says whether the committed model is current;
   3. `plantcode layout report`: every line routed, skipped or unrouted with the reason, how
      and why it was routed (rack or local), the rack fill and the finding counts;
   4. look at it: `plantcode layout render --plan --png`, `--level ID`, `--section x=..|y=..
      --png` (files in `build/`; read the PNGs), and `plantcode serve` (**Layout 3D**), where
      clashing items show red and the findings are listed beside the model;
   5. fix the cause (move an item, change a nozzle, add a via, declare a zone) and go back to
      1. Move equipment before bending pipes around it.
   Commit the model with its inputs; `plantcode validate` reports `layout-model-outdated` until
   it is rebuilt. The gates `layout-plot-plan` (concept), `layout-3d` (basic) and
   `layout-detail` (detail) of `checks/checks.yaml` say what each stage needs (`plantcode
   check`).

## Outputs and provenance

The edited `layout/*.yaml` files and `dimensions` in the equipment list; the rebuilt
`layout/plant-model.yaml` (commit it with its inputs: `plantcode validate` reports
`layout-model-outdated` until it is rebuilt); the layout basis, assumed dimensions and measured
distances go into `DESIGN.md`.

9. When a tag changes in the equipment list or on a P&ID, change it here too, in the same
   commit.

## Required human judgment

Maintenance and access space, pump positions, what stands on a structure, spacing criteria
and zone extents are design choices: plantcode only flags real intersections and measures the
`separations:` you give it. A clean build is not a good layout: look at the plan and sections,
and have the layout reviewed (skill `review`, topic `layout`).
