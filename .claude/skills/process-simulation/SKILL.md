name: process-simulation
description: Solve the flowsheet in DWSIM (heat and material balance) with plantcode process simulate - write process/simulation.yaml (property package, step specs), check the deviations from the given and assumed values, and fill the missing stream values. Use when outlet temperatures, pressures, flows or compositions of compressors, exchangers, flash drums, columns or recycle loops are needed, or when assumed stream values should be checked against a rigorous calculation.

# Process simulation

## Purpose and when to use

`plantcode process simulate` builds a DWSIM flowsheet from `process/flowsheet.yaml` and
`process/simulation.yaml`, solves it headless and writes the results back as `calculated` values.
Use it once the flowsheet's steps, streams and feeds stand (`process-design`) and stream values
downstream of the feeds are needed or assumed: outlet states of compressors, pumps, expanders,
heaters and coolers, valves, mixers and splitters, flash drums, two-stream heat exchangers,
shortcut and rigorous columns, and recycle loops. `plantcode process propagate` covers only
pass-through, mixer and splitter balances; simulate covers the energy balance and separations.

## Required inputs and missing inputs

- Every feed stream with temperature, absolute pressure, flow and composition (given or
  assumed). A missing one is `sim-feed-incomplete`: ask for it or mark an assumption.
- Components in `process/materials.yaml` with CAS numbers; a component DWSIM does not find by
  CAS needs its DWSIM name under `components:`.
- The property package (`property_package:`), from `thermodynamic-model-selection`, never
  chosen silently. Supported: Peng-Robinson (PR), Peng-Robinson 1978 (PR78),
  Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK), NRTL, UNIQUAC, Steam Tables (IAPWS-IF97), CoolProp.
- The specs of every step (`plantcode schema process-simulation` lists them per unit):
  outlet pressure and efficiency of machines, outlet temperature or duty of heaters and
  coolers, the flash temperature or pressure (none: adiabatic), the exchanger's hot or cold
  outlet temperature, the column's keys or stages and end specs. Each spec is a quantity with
  provenance: an efficiency taken from experience is `assumed` with its source. Ask for what
  the design basis does not state; do not invent specs.
- DWSIM: the Docker image (`docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t plantcode-dwsim:9.0.5 -f
  docker/dwsim/Dockerfile .` in the plantcode repository) or `PLANTCODE_DWSIM_PATH`. Without
  it, `sim-unavailable`: report it, do not estimate the values instead.

## Workflow and tools

1. Write `process/simulation.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   schema: plantcode/simulation/v1
   kind: simulation
   property_package: Peng-Robinson (PR)
   specs:
     K1: {outlet_pressure: {value: 8, provenance: given}, efficiency: {value: 0.78, provenance: assumed, source: vendor typical}}
     E1: {outlet_temperature: {value: 35, provenance: given}, pressure_drop: {value: 0.2, unit: bar, provenance: assumed}}
     C1:
       light_key: C3
       heavy_key: NC4
       light_key_in_bottoms: 0.01
       heavy_key_in_distillate: 0.02
       reflux_ratio: 3.5
       condenser_pressure: {value: 5.2, provenance: assumed}
       reboiler_pressure: {value: 5.5, provenance: assumed}
   ```

   Steps map to unit operations by their DEXPI class; give `unit:` where the class does not
   say. `exclude: [step or block ids]` simulates the rest: the streams from the excluded part
   need their values (given or assumed). Use it to simulate what the units cover while a part
   (a double column with side draws, a reactor) is still assumed. Adsorbers and membranes are
   component separators (`recoveries`), a main heat exchanger a multi-stream exchanger
   (`outlet_temperatures` for all streams but one). Flash and column outlets are recognised by port ids (`vapour`, `liquid`, `top`,
   `bottom`), exchanger sides by matching ids (`hot_in`/`hot_out`); else give `outlets:` or
   `pairs:`.
2. `plantcode validate`: `simulation.yaml` against its schema, specs for unknown steps.
3. `plantcode process simulate --check`: solves and reports, writes nothing. Read every
   `sim-deviation` (a given or assumed value the simulation contradicts) and the summary lines
   (duties, power, minimum reflux, stages).
4. Start a column with the shortcut method (keys, reflux ratio); the minimum reflux ratio and
   stages it prints give the rigorous column (`stages`, `feed_stage`, `condenser_spec`,
   `reboiler_spec`) its first numbers. A reflux ratio below the minimum does not converge.
5. `plantcode process simulate --fill [--save process/simulation.dwxmz]`, then
   `plantcode process props --fill` for phase, density and enthalpy, `plantcode process build`
   and `plantcode validate`. Record the run in `PROGRESS.md`.

## Validation and failure handling

- `sim-unmapped`: a step's class maps to no unit, a unit has the wrong number of streams, or
  energy streams do not fit; give `unit:` or split the step.
- `sim-spec`: a spec is missing, contradictory or out of range; the message names it.
- `sim-not-converged` (exit 3): nothing is written. Check the specs for feasibility (reflux
  above the minimum, outlet temperatures that the duty can reach, a column spec its stages can
  meet), save the flowsheet with `--save` and open it in DWSIM to look.
- `sim-recycle` (info): where a loop was torn; give `tear_streams:` to tear elsewhere, and
  `guesses: {stream: {temperature, pressure, flow, composition}}` in `simulation.yaml` if it
  converges slowly. A guess is no stream value: never put one into the flowsheet as `assumed`,
  where it would stay and contradict the result.
- `sim-deviation`: never overwrite the given or assumed value to silence it. Either the
  assumption is wrong (change it, with a decision in `DESIGN.md`) or a spec is (change the
  spec); an engineer decides which.
- `sim-stale`: feeds, specs, package or DWSIM changed since the values were written; fill again.

Not simulated (keep these parts assumed and `exclude:` them): rigorous columns with side draws,
a partial condenser or a heat-integrated condenser-reboiler (an air separation double column),
reactors, solids. Evaporators and dryers need `unit:` (their heat duty matters; a component
separator would drop it). A unit simulates one duty: a machine's cooling water or a cooler's pump
power stays a given or assumed value.

## Outputs and provenance

Simulated streams get `temperature`, `pressure`, `flow` and `composition` (energy streams
their `duty`) with `provenance: calculated`, source `plantcode process simulate: DWSIM
<version>, <property package>` and a fingerprint of the simulator model. Given and assumed values
stay; `--save` writes the DWSIM flowsheet (`.dwxmz`, a generated file: commit it only if the
project wants it). The specs and their provenance in `simulation.yaml` are the record of what
was assumed.

## Required human judgment

The property package and its validity for the mixture and conditions; every assumed spec
(efficiencies, pressure drops, approach temperatures, reflux ratio, column stages and key
specs); whether a deviation means the assumption or the spec is wrong; whether a converged
recycle or column is physically sensible. A simulated value is no more certain than its specs.
