name: thermodynamic-model-selection
description: Recommend a thermodynamic model (equation of state or activity-coefficient model) for a mixture from facts about pressure, polarity, electrolytes, interaction parameters, liquid-liquid split, pseudocomponents and vapour association, with Carlson's decision tree. Use before a phase or flash calculation and before choosing the property method in process/materials.yaml.

# Thermodynamic model selection

## Purpose and when to use

Recommends thermodynamic models with a rule engine that implements E. C. Carlson's decision tree
(Chem. Eng. Prog. 92, 1996, 35-46). Use it when a model has to be chosen or justified, before a
phase calculation (`phase-calculation`) and before recording a property method in
`process/materials.yaml`. The recommendation is not a validated choice.

## Required inputs and missing inputs

`ThermoModelSelectionInput`, every field optional: `pressure_value` with `pressure_unit`
(absolute: `bar(a)`, `atm`, `Pa`, ...), `is_polar`, `is_electrolyte`,
`interaction_parameters_available`, `vapor_association_expected`, `liquid_liquid_expected`,
`has_pseudocomponents`, `polymerization_degree` (`dimer`, `hexamer`).

Fill in only what the information given or well-established chemistry supports (classify each
compound as polar or nonpolar); leave the rest unset. The function raises
`InsufficientFactsError` naming the facts the tree still needs (`missing_facts`, with a
question for each): ask for exactly those and call again.

## Workflow and tools

```python
from plantcode.domains.process.thermodynamics.model_selection import select_thermo_model

result = select_thermo_model(
    {"pressure_value": 5, "pressure_unit": "bar(a)", "is_polar": True, "is_electrolyte": False}
)
result.models, result.reasoning, result.triggered_rules, result.provided_facts, result.source
```

There is no CLI command. Units go through `plantcode.foundation.units`; units other than K,
°C, Pa, kPa, MPa, bar and the `(a)`/`(g)` pressures need the `units` extra.

## Validation and failure handling

- An unknown input, a value outside a fact's possible values, or a pressure without its unit
  raises `ValueError`.
- No outcome: explain why from the reasoning trace; do not pick a model yourself.

## Outputs and provenance

Report the recommended models with the reasoning, the rules that fired, the facts used
(`pressure_band` is derived from the pressure) and `source`, the literature of the knowledge
base. Use the exact model names in the next step. When the choice becomes the plant's property
method, record it and its reason in `DESIGN.md`.

## Required human judgment

Polarity, an expected liquid-liquid split and association are judgments: state each as an
assumption so it can be reviewed. An engineer accepts or overrides the recommendation.
