# Stages

The stages are listed in `plant.yaml`; the gates of each are in `checks/checks.yaml`. A gate on
P&ID content is `kind: on-sheet` (tags and classes found in the model), never a `grep` over the
XML: DEXPI builds printed tags such as `AIA-3103` from several attributes, so grep finds ids,
not tags.

A stage is **reached** when its sign-off (`plantcode check --stage <stage> --write`, an entry in
`checks/status.json`) is on the default branch. Stage work is done on a branch
`stage/<stage>-<topic>`; the sign-off is its last commit, and the branch is merged by a human or
the reviewer, not by its author (see `AGENTS.md`). A sign-off left on an unmerged branch has not
taken effect.

## concept: Concept and feasibility
Design basis agreed (assumed values marked `ASSUMED`), block flow, main equipment identified,
the equipment, line and instrument lists and `DESIGN.md` started (gates `design-basis`,
`concept-lists`, `assumptions-marked`).

## basic: Basic engineering
P&IDs complete and valid, equipment and line lists complete, design review done.

## detail: Detail engineering
Datasheets (one `equipment/datasheets/<TAG>.yaml` per equipment-list item, format in
`equipment/datasheets/README.md`, `plantcode schema datasheet`; gate `datasheets`), instrument
list, HAZOP actions closed.
