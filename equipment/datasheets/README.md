# Datasheets

One YAML file per equipment-list item: `equipment/datasheets/<TAG>.yaml`, schema
`plantcode schema datasheet`. They are the detail-stage deliverable: the `datasheets` gate in
`checks/checks.yaml` fails until every item of `equipment/equipment-list.yaml` has a valid one.

`plantcode validate` checks each file against the schema and the equipment list:
`plantcode.datasheet-not-listed` (a tag not in the list), `plantcode.datasheet-mismatch` (design
pressure or temperature, or type, other than the list says), `plantcode.datasheet-name` (file not
named after its tag). Change a value in the datasheet and the list in the same commit.

- `operating` and `design`: conditions, by key with the unit in the name (`pressure_barg`,
  `temperature_degc`, `flow_kg_h`, ...). `design.pressure_barg` and `design.temperature_degc`
  must match the list's `design_pressure_barg` / `design_temperature_degc`.
- A value is a number or text, or `{value, unit, assumed, source}`: mark every value you have not
  calculated or been given `assumed: true`, and say where it comes from in `source` (the design
  basis, a `DESIGN.md` decision).
- `sizing_basis`: the figures the item is sized from, each with its `reference`.
- `type_specific`: fields of the equipment type (a pump's NPSH, a vessel's volume, ...).
- `nozzles`: name, DN and lines from the P&ID; where the layout fixes a nozzle's position, also
  `face` (`top`, `bottom`, `side`), `orientation_deg` (plan direction from site east,
  counter-clockwise, as `angle_deg` in `layout/equipment-placement.yaml`: of the axis for a
  side nozzle, of its offset from the item's centre for a top or bottom one), `offset_m` (a top
  or bottom nozzle's plan distance from the centre), `elevation_m` (centre above the item's
  base) and `location_source`. `plantcode validate`
  compares them with `layout/plant-model.yaml` (`plantcode.datasheet-nozzle-layout`), so the
  datasheet that goes to the supplier and the layout say the same; once any datasheet gives a
  location, a nozzle the placement overrides without one on its datasheet is reported too.

`plantcode datasheets draft [--tag T]` writes a draft for each listed item without a datasheet
(it never touches an existing one): type, service, design conditions and material from the
equipment list, dimensions, nozzles from the P&IDs, inlet and outlet conditions of the flowsheet
streams linked to the item; every value with its `source`, what the lists cannot give `TBD`
(the size keys the equipment estimate reads: `area_m2`, `volume_m3`, `shaft_power_kw`,
`fluid_power_kw`, `gas_flow_m3_s`, `duty_kw`), and `draft: true`. Complete it and remove
`draft: true`: the `datasheets` gate does not count a draft.

`plantcode datasheets fill [--tag T] [--param name=value]` fills the TBD sizes of the drafts
with calculated values and their basis (exchanger duty, LMTD and area; pump head, NPSH available
and power along the routed lines; compressor stages and power; column shortcut stages; vessel
volume and residence time against `residence_times` in `process/design-basis.yaml`). It never
overwrites a value it did not write; what it cannot calculate stays TBD with the reason.
`plantcode datasheets fill --list` names the parameters a datasheet can declare in
`type_specific` (efficiencies, arrangement, typical-U row, ...).

Example, `equipment/datasheets/P-101A.yaml`:

```yaml
tag: P-101A
type: CentrifugalPump
service: Feed pump
operating:
  flow_m3_h: {value: 12.5, unit: m3/h, source: process/design-basis.yaml capacity}
  suction_pressure_barg: 0.3
  discharge_pressure_barg: {value: 6.0, unit: barg, assumed: true, source: DESIGN.md D-004}
  temperature_degc: 25
design:
  pressure_barg: 10
  temperature_degc: 80
materials:
  casing: 1.4408
  impeller: 1.4408
  seal: {value: single mechanical seal, assumed: true}
sizing_basis:
  - {parameter: rated flow, value: "110 % of normal", reference: DESIGN.md D-004}
  - {parameter: differential head, value: {value: 62, unit: m, assumed: true}, reference: DESIGN.md D-005}
type_specific:
  npsh_available_m: {value: 4.5, unit: m, assumed: true}
  driver_kw: 5.5
