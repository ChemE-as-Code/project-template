# Working in this plant repository

This repository is a process plant design. The files are the design; there is no other database.

## Ground rules

- P&IDs are DEXPI 2.0.1 XML in `pid/`. Edit them **directly as text** (skills `dexpi-xml`,
  `pid-edit`, `pid-draft`). Do not type the verbose drawing XML: `cheme copy` duplicates an
  object with its drawing (a spare pump, a second valve), `cheme fragment` prints equipment
  with nozzles, lines, segments, valves, tees, pipes, instruments, signal lines (with the
  actuating system), off-page connectors, notes and missing catalogue shapes ready to paste,
  enough to draft a whole sheet. Change what is already on a sheet with `cheme move` (an
  object's drawing), `cheme rename` (an id with every reference, or a tag with its labels)
  and `cheme set` (one data value and the labels showing it) before reaching for a hand
  edit; hand edits remain for re-pointing references and moving blocks. For what fragments
  cannot express, a generator script in
  `scripts/draft_<sheet>.py` uses the Python API `chemeascode.domains.piping.authoring` (the same builders as
  `fragment`; example `scripts/example_draft.py`). Run it with `cheme run`: `python3` and
  `uv run python` have no pyDEXPI in this repository. Never write your own XML helpers.
- Every sheet is either **hand-maintained** (the default: the XML is the source; a script in
  `scripts/` is provenance only and is never rerun over the sheet) or **generated** (its
  `plant.yaml` entry has `generator: {script, frame}`: the script is the source, the XML is not
  edited by hand, `cheme regen <sheet>` rebuilds it). `cheme regen --detach <sheet>`
  turns a generated sheet into a hand-maintained one. `cheme validate` warns
  (`generated-sheet-drift`) when a generated sheet no longer matches its script.
- The block and process flow diagrams (`process/BFD.xml`, `process/PFD.xml`, `kind: bfd|pfd` in
  `plant.yaml`) are **generated** from `process/materials.yaml` and `process/flowsheet.yaml` by
  `cheme process build` (skill `process-design`). Change the YAML and rebuild, never the XML
  (`cheme.generated-edited`). Stream values carry their provenance (`given` with a `source`,
  `assumed`, `calculated` by `cheme process propagate --fill`, `cheme process simulate
  --fill` or `cheme process props --fill` only); `DESIGN.md` keeps the
  decisions, not a second copy of the numbers. P&IDs start from the PFD (skill `pid-draft`).
- After every change: `cheme fmt <sheet>`, then `cheme validate`. Fix every `error`. Do not
  commit with errors; the pre-commit hook and CI refuse it anyway. Never bypass the hook
  (`git commit --no-verify`, `-c core.hooksPath=...`): fix what it reports, or stop and say so.
- One logical change per commit. Say what changed on which sheet and why. Append the change to
  `PROGRESS.md`.
- Keep the lists in step with the P&IDs (skill `lists-sync`), and the 3D layout in `layout/`
  in step with the equipment list (skill `layout-yaml`; routes `pipe-routing`, steel and access
  `structures-access`, zones `area-classification`).
- Record decisions and assumptions in `DESIGN.md`, with the reason. Mark assumed values
  `ASSUMED` in the YAML or the decision text, never present a guess as data.
- **Branches and merges.** Each stage, and any change larger than one fix, goes on its own
  branch `stage/<stage>-<topic>` (e.g. `stage/basic-p04-products`); small fixes may go straight
  to the default branch (`main`). The branch is reviewed with `cheme diff main --list`, quoted
  in the review record, and merged by a human or the reviewer, never by its author. Merge once
  the review's critical and high findings are closed. A stage sign-off is the last commit on
  its branch and counts only once it is merged: a stage is reached when its sign-off is on the
  default branch. End your summary by saying whether a merge is pending.
- Do not edit `checks/status.json` or `build/` by hand; they are generated. `build/` is ignored.
- `checks/status.json` records stage sign-offs: `cheme check` only prints the gates;
  `cheme check --stage <stage> --write --review reviews/<record>.md` adds that stage's entry
  (commit, date, signer, branch, review record, the gates of every stage up to it). It refuses
  on uncommitted changes, a failing gate, a review you wrote yourself (without a human
  `approved_by`) or an open critical/high finding, counting one closed by a commit not in
  HEAD's history (skill `review`, step 7). Never sign off your
  own review, and never edit `status.json` by hand.

- **How to run commands** (also headless, where every denied command costs a turn):
  - change files with the Edit and Write tools only -- never `sed -i`, `awk`, `perl -i`, `cp`
    over a sheet, heredocs (`cat > f <<EOF`, `python3 - <<EOF`) or shell redirection into
    repository files. A shell rewrite of a 50,000-line DEXPI file is unreviewable and fails
    silently when a pattern matches zero or several times;
  - one command per Bash call: no `for` loops, `&&` / `;` chains, pipes into files or
    `VAR=...;` prefixes. Read with `cheme show`, `grep`, `sed -n 'A,Bp'`, `head`, `wc`;
  - scratch files go in `build/` (ignored), never next to the sheets.

## Commands

| | |
|---|---|
| `cheme status [--json]` | start here: stage, each sheet drawn / empty / planned with the listed items it does not draw yet, the next sheet to draw, findings by sheet, gates per stage, sign-offs (and whether merged), open review findings, branch state |
| `cheme impact [--json]` | review needed (info, read-only): review records whose scope or `basis` changed since, generated sheets whose `process/*.yaml` changed, stale calculated values; nothing is regenerated |

| `cheme datasheets draft \| fill [--tag T] [--param name=value] [--dry-run]` | `draft`: a draft datasheet per listed item without one; `fill`: the sizes a draft leaves TBD (exchanger area, pump head and NPSH, compressor power, column stages, residence time) calculated with their basis, never over a given value (skill `datasheets`) |
| `cheme assess lca [--csv \| --inventory \| --dataset \| --coverage \| --json] [--write \| --check]` | the LCA per functional unit (skill `lca`): operation (the flowsheet's feeds and products in the case of `lca/lca.yaml`) and construction (take-off, equipment weights), allocated between co-products, characterised with `lca/factors.yaml` or a Brightway project, baseline and scenarios; every exchange without a burden is a gap (`lca/gaps.csv`), never 0; the result is classified complete, screening, partial or unavailable (`--coverage` says why); `--inventory` / `--dataset` alone export the foreground without any background; `--write` into `lca/` |
